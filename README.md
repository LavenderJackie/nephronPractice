# nephronPractice
practicing stuff like golang and html.......

things i have installed for this:
- node.js/npm
    - npm install tailwindcss
- basic golang stuff

i think thats it for the time being?????

and yes i know its bad practice to have the file structure thats happening here but im just trying to get stuff up and running..........
like i know its bad that i have project->src->project->src but.......eeh this is private who's gonna judge me for this shit anyways uwu

some cmd line stuff ive used here (a little different than the linux stuff ive used at work)
- test-app
  - npx create-react-app name
  - cd name
  - npm start
- tailwind-test
  - npx create-next-app -e with-tailwindcss name
  - cd name .........
  - stuff from command line::
    - yarn dev (start dev server)
    - yarn build (build app for production)
    - yarn start (run in production mode)
- backend stuff -> make sure file is main.go
  - downloaded golang
  - go mod init example.com/web-service-gin
  - go get .
  - go run .

other stuff i can try to practice later:
- linux/xubuntu stuff (cd ls general os and cmd line stuff)
