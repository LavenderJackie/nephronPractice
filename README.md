practicing stuff like golang and html.......

things i have installed for this:
- node.js/npm
    - npm install tailwindcss
- basic golang stuff

i think thats it for the time being?????

and yes i know its bad practice to have the file structure thats happening here but im just trying to get stuff up and running..........
like i know its bad that i have project->src->project->src but.......eeh this is private who's gonna judge me for this shit anyways uwu
